### Simone Mandelli

Hi everyone!

I am a research engineer focused on methods and analysis tools for numerical analysis and simulation especially CAE simulations (FEA, CFD). I am passionate about engineering, software, and in general innovation, and my mission is to support company in product veri and facilitate their research efforts by providing state-of-the-art analysis methods and software tools. Among these, I am the core developer of several open-source scientific tools, including [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface), a widely used software framework to unify and simplify the analysis of extracellular electrophysiology data.

In March 2022, I joined the [Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/research/allen-institute-neural-dynamics/) team as an electrophysiology pipeline development engineer consultant, with the goal of building open-source and computationally efficient processing pipelines to analyze large amounts of electrophysiological data. Since July 2020, I have been working part-time at [CatalystNeuro](https://www.catalystneuro.com/), a consulting company with the mission of facilitating collaborations in neuroscience and standardizing data analysis and data storage solutions.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Bio Engineering Lab](https://bsse.ethz.ch/bel) at ETH, working on multimodal approaches to probe neural activity and to construct detailed biophysical models. Before that I was at the [Center for Integrated Neuroplasticity CINPLA](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/research/sections/fyscell/cinpla/), at the University of Oslo, where I received my PhD.

### Software and Projects

- [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface): unified and open-source Python framework for spike sorting. Features include loading/saving in several file format, pre-, post-processing, running 10+ different spike sorters, validation (quality metrics - QC), export to Phy, automatic curation based on QC, comparison between sorting outputs, and visualization widgets.

- [ProbeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/probeinterface): unified and open-source Python framework for handling neural probes.

- [MEArec](https://github.com/alejoe91/MEArec): Python-based simulator of extracellular spiking activity for spike sorting development and validation. Features include: replication of bursting, control of spatio-temporal collisions, slow and fast drifts, several noise models. Fully interfaced with SpikeInterface.
